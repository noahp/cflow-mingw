Version 1.6, 2019-02-23

* New option --all (-A)

Produce graphs for all global functions in the program.  Use this
option if your program contains functions which are not directly
reachable from main().

The output consist of separate flow graphs for each global function
defined in the program.  These graphs will be placed after the graph
for main() (if it exists), and will be ordered lexicographically by
the function name.

* New option --no-main

This option has the same effect as '--all', except that the graph for
main() function (if it exists) is treated same way as all the other
graphs, i.e. it will not be placed at the top of output, but in its
place as per the lexicographic ordering of function names.


Version 1.5, 2016-05-17

* Correctly handle functions returning struct/union (fixes bug #31792)
* Gracefully handle invalid inputs (fixes bug #44113)
* Debugging output goes to stderr
* Add a manpage
* Consistent use of exit codes


Version 1.4, 2011-10-11

* Symbol aliases

The `--symbol' option has been extended to allow for defining
symbol aliases.  Aliases are useful for declaring reserved
words such as `__restrict' or `__inline'.  For example,
the option `--symbol __restrict:=restrict' instructs cflow
to treat `__restrict' exactly as `restrict'.

* New syntactic class: qualifiers

Tokens in this class can legitimately appear in place
of C qualifiers, such as `static' or `inline'.  This class
is useful for some compiler-depending keywords, such as
`__extension__' in gcc.  The usual declaration of this symbol
is `--symbol __extension__:qualifier'.

* Speed up recursive call detection.

* Fix parsing of typedefs after `struct'.
* Fix the output of branch marks in tree mode.
* Fix processing of static inline functions (RH bug 650716).


Version 1.3, 2009-07-11

New symbol tables considerably improve the program performance.

* Bugfixes.
