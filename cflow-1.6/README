* Introduction

This file contains brief information about configuring, and installing
GNU cflow. It is *not* intended as a replacement for the
documentation, instead it is provided as a brief reference only.
Please be sure to read the accompanuing documentation before using the
utility. See section `Documentation' below.

For the generic configuration options, see the file `INSTALL'.
Refer to file `ABOUT-NLS' for information regarding internationalization.

* History

The GNU cflow was initially written in 1997, when I needed a utility
that could display the control flow in a C program. The latest updates
in its old repo date back to 1999. Then, as I no longer needed the
package, it fell into oblivion.

Six years later a thread in gnu-devel mailing list had shown that
there is a kind of demand for that sort of utility, so I decided to
resurrect it and make a full-fledged package of it. On 2005-04-12 it
was dubbed a GNU package.

* Current Status

The package is fully operational. It compiles and runs on any
GNU/Linux and most decent UNIX-like systems. It supports all command
line switches required by POSIX, plus a number of extended ones. It is
able to produce output in two formats: in GNU cflow format (which is
the default) and in POSIX format.

Currently the utility is only able to process C sources. It is the
only deviation from POSIX specs, which requires ability to process
YACC and LEX sources as well as binary object files. This support will
appear in future versions.

Emacs module cflow-mode.el works with files in GNU cflow format (as
opposed to POSIX format). It has been tested with Emacs 24.2.1.

* Compilation

Please see the INSTALL file in this directory for the generic instructions
on how to use configure. There is currently only one package-specific
configuration option: --enable-debug, which compiles the package with
-g (or -ggdb if appropriate) option. Use it if you plan debugging
cflow.

* Installation

After running `./configure' and `make', run `make install'.

* Configuration File

The file src/cflow.rc provides a working configuration file for use
with gcc.  See the documentation, sections 6.1 "Syntactic classes" and
6.3 "GCC Initialization", for more information.

* Documentation

Complete user manual in texinfo format is provided. After the
installation, it will be accessible by running `info cflow'. To read it
before installing the package, run `info -f doc/cflow' from the
package source root directory.

If you don't have GNU texinfo installed, see
http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo for information on where to obtain it.
